    "\n",
    "1. **Databricks Jobs:** An imperative approach, ideal for simple, scheduled tasks.\n",
    "2. **Delta Live Tables:** A declarative approach, ideal for building robust, observable data pipelines."

    "\n",
    "### To Try It Yourself:\n",
    "1. In the left navigation bar, select **SQL Editor**.\n",
    "2. Ensure a SQL Warehouse is selected in the top-right.\n",
    "3. Run the query below to explore the clean, aggregated data produced by one of the demo pipelines."

    "\n",
    "### To See How it Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can schedule any notebook to run as a Job by clicking the **Schedule** button in the top-right corner of the notebook UI. This will take you to the Jobs UI where you can define the schedule and compute.\n",

    "## Orchestration Method 2: Delta Live Tables (The Declarative Approach)\n",
    "\n",
    "For building robust data pipelines, **Delta Live Tables (DLT)** is the modern, recommended approach. It's a *declarative* framework: instead of defining the *steps* of your pipeline, you simply define the *end state* of your tables using standard SQL or Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "DLT automatically manages the underlying infrastructure, orchestration, data quality monitoring, and error handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your setup script already deployed a DLT pipeline from the `pipeline-bike` demo!\n",
    "\n",
    "### To Explore the DLT Pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **See the Definition:** In your workspace, navigate to the `pipeline-bike` demo folder and open the **`01-DLT-Pipeline-SQL`** notebook. This is the simple SQL code that defines the entire pipeline.\n",
    "2. **See it Running:** Use the link generated by the setup script (or go to `Workflows > Delta Live Tables`) to see the live pipeline graph. You can monitor data flowing through the bronze, silver, and gold tables and see data quality scores.\n",
