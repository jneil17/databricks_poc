    "## Common AI Agent Patterns to Explore\n",
    "\n",
    "Building a custom AI agent can be complex, so Databricks provides several pre-built patterns and capabilities that you can explore and customize.\n",
    "\n",
    "--- \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Knowledge Assistant (Retrieval-Augmented Generation - RAG)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most common pattern. A RAG agent can \"chat\" with your documents or structured data, providing answers grounded in your proprietary information. This is powered by **Databricks Vector Search**.\n",
    "\n",
    "📖 **Resources:**\n",
    "* [Best Practices for RAG on Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2023/10/25/best-practices-for-llm-evaluation-of-rag-applications.html)\n",
    "* [Vector Search Documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/en/generative-ai/vector-search.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "--- \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Information Extraction Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "This agent can read unstructured documents (like PDFs, emails, or images) and extract structured data (like invoice numbers, dates, and amounts), saving it to a Delta table for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "📖 **Resource:** [Intelligent Document Processing with Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/solutions/accelerators/intelligent-document-processing)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Custom LLMs (Finetuning)\n",
    "\n",
    "For advanced use cases, you can use the Finetuning API to adapt an open-source LLM on your private data. This creates a model that is an expert in your specific domain, using your company's terminology and style.\n",
