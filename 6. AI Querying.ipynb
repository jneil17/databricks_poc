    "\n",
    "### üéØ **Prompt Engineering Tips:**\n",
    "1. **Be specific** in your prompts - clear instructions get better results\n",
    "2. **Limit response length** when needed (e.g., \"respond in one word\")\n",
    "3. **Provide context** about the data you're analyzing\n",
    "4. **Use consistent formatting** for structured outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ö° **Performance Considerations:**\n",
    "1. **Batch processing** - Process multiple rows efficiently rather than single calls\n",
    "2. **Cache results** when possible to avoid repeated API calls\n",
    "3. **Filter data first** - Apply WHERE clauses before using ai_query\n",
    "4. **Monitor costs** - AI model calls consume compute resources\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîí **Security Notes:**\n",
    "1. **Don't send sensitive data** to external models unless approved\n",
    "2. **Use appropriate endpoints** - some models may have data residency requirements\n",
    "3. **Review outputs** - AI responses should be validated for business use"

    "1. **Be specific** in your prompts - clear instructions get better results\n",
    "2. **Limit response length** when needed (e.g., \"respond in one word\")\n",
    "3. **Provide context** about the data you're analyzing\n",
    "4. **Use consistent formatting** for structured outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ö° **Performance Considerations:**\n",
    "1. **Batch processing** - Process multiple rows efficiently rather than single calls\n",
    "2. **Cache results** when possible to avoid repeated API calls\n",
    "3. **Filter data first** - Apply WHERE clauses before using ai_query\n",
    "4. **Monitor costs** - AI model calls consume compute resources\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîí **Security Notes:**\n",
    "1. **Don't send sensitive data** to external models unless approved\n",
    "2. **Use appropriate endpoints** - some models may have data residency requirements\n",
    "3. **Review outputs** - AI responses should be validated for business use"
